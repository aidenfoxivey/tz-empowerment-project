We have several ways for you to make a difference in the lives of young people and their families in Tanzania. Each of these options are totally scalable to whatever is most feasible for you to contribute.

We want to foster an environment where everyone can make actual change in terms of their impact on the world.

## A few ways to help!

### 1: Sponsor a student.

This is our most classic method of helping. Essentially, you pledge to support the tuition costs of students as they go through school. We ensure that when you sponsor a student, you have a real connection with them.

You are able to communicate and will receive videos/updates as they progress through their education.

In the past, we've had many people become attached and send all sorts of presents for special occaisions, which never fails to make their students happy.

### 2: Donate to the project directly.

Since we are a nonprofit with several operational costs, we do need some funding to be able to continue operating.

Please note that there is no person or foundation that is making any salary through this. Every board member is volunteering and does not receive compensation for their time.

We constantly aim to reduce our operating costs and have more efficient planning on our Tanzanian side to ensure that the largest percentage of money ends up with having actual impact rather than being eaten up by administration costs.

### 3: Volunteer or fundraise.

If you have special skills (web development, accounting, marketing, etc.), we would certainly love to see what sort of role you could play in volunteering with the Tanzania Empowerment Project.

We are involved in it because we think it's a great project and one that will make serious positive impact in the lives of many young people in Tanzania.
