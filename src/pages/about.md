Why we opt for paying for school.

Our partners in Arusha, Tanzania help identify children who may not have the opportunity to attend school due to poverty. Even ‚Äúfree‚Äù public education can be costly for parents as there are fees for books, uniforms and exams. Even for those who can afford the fees for public schools, the quality of the instruction is low and results in limited post secondary opportunities.

Mom2Mom sources quality private schools that provide an education that meaningfully impacts the future of these young children.
