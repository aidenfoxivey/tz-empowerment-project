We are a Canadian Not-for-Profit Organization, founded in 2012. Our mandate is to empower women and children through education. The benefits of education and global awareness apply to us all. We hope the stories and information here will inspire you, as it has inspired all of us, children and adults alike, who are involved in The Tanzania Empowerment Project.
