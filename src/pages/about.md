Why we opt for paying for school

Our mandate is to empower women and children through education. The benefits of education and global awareness apply to us all. According to the UN, "the education of girls and young women -- with its dividends of poverty alleviation, gender equality, HIV/AIDS reduction -- is the single most effective means by which so many of the problems blocking Africa's development can be overcome."

Our partners in Arusha, Tanzania help identify children who may not have the opportunity to attend school due to poverty. Even ‚Äúfree‚Äù public education can be costly for parents as there are fees for books, uniforms and exams. Even for those who can afford the fees for public schools, the quality of the instruction is low and results in limited post secondary opportunities. 

Mom2Mom sources quality private schools that provide an education that meaningfully impacts the future of these young children.
