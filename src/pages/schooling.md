As of 2022, the second largest cause for dropping out of university were financial reasons.[^1] In addition, the highest paying courses of study are currently male dominated, with engineering and earth sciences having a ratio of ~4.5 men for each woman enrolled. 

#### Costs

A year of tuition for undergraduate studies is on average 1 340 000 Tanzanian shillings, which is approximately 730 Canadian dollars. 

Note that these costs are purely tuition; they do not factor in books or accomodations. If you choose to sponsor a student, we will calculate and provide you with all the information about the total costs.

In finding the costs, we used numbers from the [University of Dar es Salaam](https://udsm.ac.tz/web/index.php/undergraduate-fees), which is regarded as one of the premier institutes in Tanzania.
